# Connect - Union

This is a fork of [connect](http://github.com/senchalabs/connect) to test the compatibility of the latest connect plugins with [union](http://github.com/flatiron/union) middleware

This has been already done by pksunkara with an older connect version: https://github.com/pksunkara/connect-union
I've just followed his footsteps using Connect 2.4.4

## Why union is better than connect?

As a middleware, union is better than connect because:

* It can deal with streams by default.
* You can use events instead of passing around a callback, the event emitter provided allows a context associated with middleware rather than relying on adding things to req. This conceptual divide allows a focus on contextual business logic and separation of concerns (the in/out vs the evaluation of the in/out) makes it simpler to know if a field is something a middleware is providing

## Compatibility testing

* Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git://github.com/framp/connect-union
```

* Test compatibility

```bash
npm install
make test
```
